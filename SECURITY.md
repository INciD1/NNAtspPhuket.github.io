## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you want to use it just install the library as follow
-google maps
-scipy
-spacy
-Geocoding
-flask
-numpy

Just download the code and run it in your VS code or other Complier that support python 3.12.3 and you have to install the lib as I inform you earlier, and I dont updated that much sometimes I will update it sooner or later

AND DONT FORGET ABOUT THIS NOT TO DEPLOY THE PROJECT!!!!!!

Hope you have fun with my project :D
